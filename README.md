Generate palindromes from English word list

These are some quick scripts that I made in about 4 hours to generate palindromes based on a list of 100,000
English words that I downloaded.

It runs quickly for small sets of words and for words with few letters.  We have to pick through the results to
find ones that make sense grammatically.  But it was a fun exercise that produced a few gems like these:

* yay bob yay
* doc did cod
* dad gag dad
* to pee pot
* able Melba
* amoral aroma
* ammo momma
* amen enema
* ate feta
* a gas saga
* a tad data
* tie it
* see bees
* party trap
* loo tool
* tin unit
