Generate palindromes from English word list

These are some quick scripts that I made in a couple evenings to generate palindromes using a free list of English
words that I downloaded.

The results of typical fast runs (limiting to a few short words) are plentiful...although not always grammatically
sensible.  Below are some of the "better" ones from a quick run.  (My laptop fan grinds from overheating if I run
the scripts too long.)

...yay bob yay
...doc did cod
...dad gag dad
...to pee pot
...able Melba
...amoral aroma
...ammo momma
...amen enema
...ate feta
...a gas saga
...a lag gala
...a tad data
