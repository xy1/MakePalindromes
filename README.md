Generate palindromes from English word list

These are some quick scripts that I made in a couple evenings to generate palindromes using a free list of English
words that I downloaded.

Typical fast runs (limiting to a few short words) can produce a lot of results...although not always ones that are grammatically meaningful.  Below are some of the "better" ones from a quick run.  (My laptop fan grinds from overheating if I run the scripts too long, so we shouldn't expect them to find another "a man a plan a canal panama" or
"able was i ere i saw elba" any time soon.)

* yay bob yay
* doc did cod
* dad gag dad
* to pee pot
* able Melba
* amoral aroma
* ammo momma
* amen enema
* ate feta
* a gas saga
* a tad data
* tie it
* see bees
* party trap
* loo tool
* tin unit
